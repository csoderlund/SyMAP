**Description**: SyMAP (Synteny Mapping and Analysis Program) is a software package for detecting, displaying, and querying syntenic relationships between sequenced chromosomes and/or FPC physical maps.  It is designed for medium-to-high divergent eukaryotic genomes (not bacteria). It can align a draft genome to a fully sequenced genome, but not draft-to-draft.

**Requirements**: Java v1.7 or later and MySQL. SyMAP uses [MUMmer](http://mummer.sourceforge.net) for the sequence to sequence alignment, which requires Perl. SyMAP has been tested on Linux and MacOSX.

**SyMAP package**: The SyMAP package contains the jar files, external packages and demo files.

**SyMAP github code**: This site contains all necessary external classes and packages. To install, see SyMAP/java/README.
