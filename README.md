**Description**: SyMAP (Synteny Mapping and Analysis Program) is a software package for detecting, displaying, and querying syntenic relationships between a fully sequenced genome and (i) another sequenced genome, (ii) draft sequence, (iii) self-synteny, or (iv) FPC physical maps.  It is designed for medium-to-high divergent eukaryotic genomes (not bacteria).

**Download SyMAP tarball**: https://github.com/csoderlund/SyMAP/releases. The SyMAP tarball contains the executable jar files, external packages and demo files.

**Documentation**: https://csoderlund.github.io/SyMAP

**Requirements**: Java v1.8 or later and MySQL. SyMAP uses [MUMmer](https://mummer4.github.io) for the sequence to sequence alignment, which requires Perl. SyMAP has been tested on Linux and MacOS.

**SyMAP github code**: To build, see SyMAP/java/README.
