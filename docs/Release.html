<a id="v545"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.4.5 (4-Aug-23)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tested on <a href="SystemGuide.html#machine">Linode Ubuntu</a>.
<li><ttb>Chromosome Explorer 2D</ttb>
<ul>
<li><ttl>Sequence Filter</ttl>: See <a href="UserGuide.html#sequence_filter">Sequence Filter</a>
<ul>
<li><ttl>Gene#</ttl>: A new option of <ttl>Gene#</ttl> has been added, which will set the coordinates
of a 50kb region around the gene and highlights the gene's introns.
<li><ttl>Block#</ttl>, <ttl>Collinear#</ttl>: There are new options to show the <ttl>Block#</ttl> or <ttl>Collinear#</ttl> in the same way
as the  <ttl>Hit#</ttl> and <ttl>Hit %Id</ttl> are shown.
<li><ttl>Highlight Conserved Genes</ttl>: There is a new option to  <ttl>Highlight Conserved Genes</ttl>.
See <a href="UserGuide.html#conserved">Conserved</a>.
</ul>
<li><ttb>Hit Filter</ttb>
<ul>
<li>The <ttl>Highlight hit popup</ttl> can be on all the time (i.e.
it is not turned off if another highlight is turned on), and is highlighted in the hover color.
<li>When the hit popup highlights the hit-wire, it will also highlight the genes
assigned to it.
<li>The hit popup provides the <ttx>Gene#</ttx> of the genes that are being highlighted.
</ul>
</ul>

<li>Minor stuff
<small>
<ul>
<li><ttb>Query Table</ttb> Fixed tiny bug from v5.4.2 where the <ttl>Glen</ttl> column would not sort.
<li><ttb>Query Align</ttb> with MUSCLE, the <ttl>Cancel Alignment</ttl> button does not work, but now, it
gives a message on how the user can cancel the alignment.
<li><ttb>Block View</ttb> A clock shows when bringing up the 2D view (necessary for slow machines).
<li><ttb>2D Sequence Filter</ttb> (1) The highlighted popup gene now highlights the whole gene
(it was just the intron area and delimiter). (2) Setting sequence filters could cause consecutive duplicate views in History, i.e.
forward/back buttons, this has been fixed. (3) Old bug: when a track was reused with a different sequence,
the conditional checkboxes could be incorrectly disabled (still one problem left but need to rewrite masses of code
to fix).
</ul>
</small>

<li>Developer
<small>
<ul>
<li>Rename frame.TrackCom to frame.TrackInfo;
</ul>
</small>
</ul>

<a id="v544"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.4.4 (18-July-23)</h3>
<ul>
<li><ttb>Query</ttb>
<ul>
<li><font color=red>Bug fix for v5.4.3</font> The extension to make the <ttl>Gene#</ttl> search work with
suffixes (e.g. 5.a) had a bug when used without suffixes.
</ul>
<li><ttb>Chromosome Explorer 2D</ttb>
<ul>
<li><ttl>Sequence Filter</ttl>: There is a new option for highlighting a gene called <ttl>Popup</ttl>;
when this option is on, every time a gene popup window is created, the gene stays selected. The filter popup has
reduced number of options.
See <a href="UserGuide.html#popup">Popups</a> and <a href="UserGuide.html#sequence_filter">Sequence Filters</a>.
<li>The highlight <ttl>Hit popup</ttl> and <ttl>Gene popup</ttl> options are on by default.
</ul>
<li>Developers
<ul>
<li><small>Remove CloseupListener and DrawingPanelListener. Remove
DrawingPanelData (merge with DrawingPanel). Move TextData from util to sequence directory.  Moved frame SyMAP2d,
Frame2D, FSized2d, ControlPanel to drawingpanel because used exclusively by 2d. Rename AlignMain to AlgSynMain.
</small>
</ul>
</ul>

<a id="v543"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.4.3 (12-July-23)</h3>
There are numerous tiny changes, fixes, and two small new features.
<p>For existing databases: (1) View the database with <tt>./symap</tt> and okay the database update.
(2) Though it is not necessary to re-run the <ttb>Synteny</ttb> algorithm, there is a small improvement
for assigning hits to embedded genes.
<ul>
<li><ttb>Manager</ttb>
<ul>
<li><ttl>Synteny</ttl> For embedded genes, the algorithm was assigning the hit to the outer gene,
now it assigns it to the closest fit gene.
<li><small><i>Minor</i>: When <ttl>All Pairs</ttl> or <ttl>Selected Pair</ttl> is selected, the user will be asked to confirm
the processing. The panel is a little smaller. All frames show the database name.
Allow blank lines on annotation input. Add "Prefix" on manager summary.</small>
</ul>

<li><ttb>Chromosome Explorer 2D</ttb>
<ul>
<li><ttl>Hit Filter</ttl>: There is a new option for highlighting a hit-wire called <ttl>Popup</ttl>;
when this option is on, every time a hit-wire popup window is created, the hit-wire stays selected.
See <a href="UserGuide.html#popup">Popups</a> and <a href="UserGuide.html#hitfilter">Hit Filters</a>.
<li>When more than two sequence tracks are shown, the middle one now knows the hits on both
sides and can list them in the <ttl>Gene Popup</ttl> and <ttl>Align (Max 30kb)</ttl>.
<li><small><i>Minor</i>: The <ttl>Sequence Filter</ttl> options of <ttl>Show Text</ttl> now shows the
text on the outside of the sequence track rectangle. The panel is a little smaller.
The "Id %" is now shown on the <ttl>Hit Information</ttl>. Put <ttl>Info:</ttl> at beginning of controls.
Text popups stay in front, i.e. will not be buried behind panel. Improve the 2D information help. </small>
<li><small><i>Tiny bug fixes</i>: The end coordinate on this filter window always showed the end of the sequence
instead of the displayed end. If the <ttl>Dot Plot</ttl> was changed multiple times during
a given session of <ttl>ChrExp</ttl>, it sometimes messed up. The <ttl>Dot Plot</ttl> filters
could not be changed after the first view.</small>

</ul>
<li><ttb>Query</ttb>
<ul>
<li>The <ttl>Gene#</ttl> query option now allows a suffix; i.e. '100' will return all genes with this number
and any suffix, '100.b' will only return this gene.
<li><font color=red>Bug fix</font>: if an annotation query was performed that had a hit to a gene with embedded genes,
the gene and the overlapping genes would be returned.
<li><small><i>Minor</i>: Has a new button <ttl>Defaults</ttl> which sets the selected columns
to the defaults. In the result table, the <ttl>Gene#</ttl> is now the
first column.</small>
</ul>
<li><ttb>DotPlot</ttb>: <small><i>Minor</i>: The <ttl>Filters Defaults</ttl> option no longer closes
the window (behaves like the <ttb>2D</ttb> filters).</small>

<li>Developer
<ul><small>
<li>
The database 'props' table now keeps track of initial database version and updates.
The file util.Utilities has all the methods for
parsing the sequence 'tag'; the database tag field has a slightly different format.
Fix a tiny problem where Query would set a 2D static 'show annot' which would effect other 2D displays.
ShowContinue put 'Cancel' as the end button. Remove [Uniprot ID: xxx] from demo_seq/annotation/anno.gff.

<li>Moved track/* to sequence directory. Merged SequenceTrackData into TrackData.
Removed AnnotationData and PseudoData (was just moving data around). Rename PseudoPool to SeqPool.
Remove GroupSorter (code moved to SeqLoadMain) and improved. Change database field pseudo_hits.evalue to 'htype'
and rearrange the fields to be more logical.
</small>
</ul>
</ul>


<a id="v542"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.4.2 (28-June-23)</h3>
<ul>
<li><ttb>2D</ttb>
<ul>
<li>Redesigned the <ttl>Sequence Filter</ttl>.
<li>History only kept 10 places, now it keeps 50.
<li>Fixed bugs:
<br><small>(1) when the 2D was initiated from the DotPlot or Query, changing highlight
could change "Show" option. (2) Recent v541 DotPlot to 2d bug:
If a second block was selected for 2D, the genes would not be shown; with this fix, multiple 2D from Dotplot can be shown again.
</small>
</ul>
<li><ttb>Query</ttb>
<ul>
<li>Added an export option of HTML.
</ul>
<li>Developer:
<ul>
<li><small>The Abstract Filter file was removed and the Hit and Sequence filter codes rewritten without it.
Changed number of tracks from 100 to 30.</small>
</ul>
</ul>

<a id="v541"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.4.1 (22-June-23)</h3>
For existing SyMAP databases: there is a new column in <ttb>Query</ttb> called <ttl>NumHits</ttl>;
run <tt>symap -y</tt> to update all projects in the database.

<ul>
<li><ttb>Manager</ttb>
<ul>
<li><font color=red>Bad bug fix</font> for v5.4.0: Loading the hits would get a memory crash
if some chromosomes in a project had genes and other chromosomes did not.
<li>If only two projects are selected from the left, then their joint cell is automatically selected.
</ul>

<li><ttb>Dot Plot</ttb>
<ul>
<li><ttl>Info</ttl>: (see <a href="UserGuide.html#dotplot_display">Control Panel</a>)
A new pull down with options:
(1) <ttl>Stats</ttl>: in the <ttl>Information</ttl> area (short form),
(2) <ttl>Print</ttl>: printed to the terminal (long form), (3) <ttl>Help</ttl>.
<li>The dot colors can be changed with the Color Wheel (see <a href="UserGuide.html#image">Color Wheel</a>).

<li>Dotplot can no longer display multiple 2d from the same dotplot display. (v542 allows many again)
</ul>

<li><ttb>2D</ttb>
<ul>
<li><ttl>Info</ttl>: A new pull-down with options:
(1) <ttl>Stats</ttl>: Hovering in the gene space but not on a gene will
show summary info; hovering in the hit space but not a on hit will show hit summary
info. (2) <ttl>Help</ttl> Help will be shown instead of summary information.
<li>Display bug fix: If the "Show" filter was changed to show more hits, then changed back to show less,
the right click in hit empty space would keep showing hit-wire information.
</ul>

<li><ttb>Query</ttb>
<ul>
<li><ttl>Gene#</ttl> in the <ttl>Pair Hits</ttl> section: This query now works exactly like the other 3 in this row, i.e. you can set the
chromosome, and it returns full hits. NOTE: there will be no rows returned if there is no hit to
the gene.
<li><ttl>Single NumHits</ttl>: A column has been added to indicate whether there are any hits to the gene
in the entire database (not just those queried).
<li>Column Description: This was being shown on the bottom of display; it is now a tool tip.
<li><ttl>Clear Column</ttl>: This button has been added. It replaces the <ttl>Show Stats</ttl> button
when the columns are being shown.
</ul>

<li>Developer:
<ul>
<li><small>The MySQL connection has been rewritten to be more straight-forward and confirm that connections
are correctly closed. There is a new dedicated connection for any each of the displays (e.g. DotPlot, 2D, etc).
This removed 4 java files and replaced one.</small>
</ul>
</ul>

<a id="v540"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.4.0 (6-Apr-23)</h3>
This release focuses on improving the detection of gene homology in the <ttb>Synteny</ttb> computation.
<br>For existing databases, re-run <ttl>Alignment&Synteny</ttl> using existing MUMmer files.
<ul>
<li><ttb>Synteny</ttb>:
<ul>
<li>Creating clustered hits has been improved for long genes.
<li>Filtering hits has been updated to give preference when at least one end is a gene.
<li>Details of changes:
<small>
<br>&rarr; Long hits with embedded genes are split, which helps detect hits to the embedded genes.
<br>&rarr; When a candidate gene is created from hits, it is checked that it does not span a gene with no hits.
Candidate genes used to be created using the maximum length of the annotated genes; this is now maximum size 100k.
<br>&rarr; For finding the top N hits, the Max of query and target(summed subhits (minus overlaps)) of a clustered hit are used
instead of summed query subhits.
<br>&rarr; A clustered hit could have a mix of subhits that were on opposite strands and the same strand; this does not
happen anymore. (This is rare.)
<br>&rarr; %Identity was just using the query match; now it is Max(pct(query), pct(target)) where pct
is the approximate average %identity of the subhits.
<br>&rarr; %Similarity was the value of the first subhit of a clustered hit;
now it is computed like the %Identity.
<br>&rarr; Pair Parameters: The TopN and MinDots parameters are checked for integer and &gt;0.
When A&amp;S is executed, the non-default parameters are printed to the terminal immediately.
</small>
<li>These changes increased the number of gene homology hits for Humans to Mouse (Chrs 5,17,X) from
(68.6%, 57.0%) to (79.9%,66.3%), and for Humans to Chimpanzee (Chrs 5, X) from (53.9%, 54.6%) to
(69.9%, 56.7%).
<li>Note, these changes cause more hits to be saved, and hence, the synteny takes
a little longer. It may also remove or add small blocks due to additional intervening hits.
</ul>
<li><ttb>Summary</ttb>: See <a href="UserGuide.html#sum" class="ext" target="_blank">Summary</a>.
<ul>
<li>The summary has been rewritten in a textual format which can be copied with copy & paste.
<li>All hit and block statistics were computed in terms of <i>clustered hits</i>, which may have
gaps and overlaps between the subhits. Now many of the statistics are in terms of the subhits, and it is
clear as to whether clustered hits or their subhits are being used.
<li>Collinear sets have been added to the summary.
<li>The Project summary has exon stats, which have been removed from the <ttl>View</ttl>; the gene size ranges have
been removed.
<li>It states whether either input project had <ttl>Order Against</ttl> or <ttl>Mask genes</ttl> set.
</ul>

<li><ttb>Query</ttb>:
<ul>
<li><ttl>Hit Cov</ttl> is a new hit column, which is the maximum subhit coverage
between the two species connected by the clustered hit. The <ttl>Hit Cov</ttl> is computed by summing
the subhits and removing any overlap.
<li><ttl>Annotated (Gene Hit)</ttl> has an additional option of <ttl>Either</ttl>.
<li><ttl>Collinear size</ttl> now has the options of <ttl>&gt;=</ttl>, <ttl>=</ttl>, <ttl>&lt;=</ttl>.
<li><ttl>Export CSV</ttl> has an option to not include row number column. This is useful for comparing two
lists, where the row number can cause most rows to appear different. The quotes around columns have been
removed; any comma's in the descriptions are replaced with ";".

<li>The <ttl>Show</ttl> was disabled for singles; it has been enabled.
</ul>
<li><ttb>Chromosome Explorer</ttb>:
<ul><li>The text of the Hit popup has been slightly changed and the Subhit
coverage has been added (see <a href="UserGuide.html#popup" class="ext" target="_blank">Hit Popup</a>).
</ul>
<li>Developer:
<ul><li><small>The Hit assignment algorithm has been restructured.</small></ul>
</ul>
<a id="v535"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.3.5 (3-Mar-23)</h3>

<ul>
<li><ttl>Cancel</ttl>
<ul>
<li>The <ttl>Cancel</ttl> button did not always work well, now it does.
See <a href="SystemGuide.html#cancel" class="ext" target="_blank">Cancel</a>.
<li>From v5.3.4, if the <ttl>A&S</ttl> was cancelled or interrupted, it was not possible to restart the <ttl>A&S</ttl>
without reloading the projects.
</ul>
<li><ttl>Load project</ttl>
<ul>
<li>Any sequences that do not have the <ttl>Group prefix</ttl> will be ignored.
<li>The <ttl>Group prefix</ttl> is case-insensitive.
</ul>

<li><ttl>Align (Max 30000)</ttl>
<ul>
<li>The selected region was extended to the whole genes within it; now it just extends to the ends of the last overlapping exon of the selected region.
<li>The exons are labeled, e.g. Exon #11. If the end of the gene is not shown, a left or right arrow will be displayed
indicating that it continues. See <a href="UserGuide.html#base" class="ext" target="_blank">Align</a>.
<li>The color icons now has Exon+ and Exon-, where the default colors correspond to the 2d display.
<li>Bug fix: when there were overlapping genes, the exons could be wrong for one of them.
</ul>
<li>Developer:
<ul><li><small>The Logger interface has been removed.
In the ManagerFrame, the load methods have been moved to LoadProj, and the remove methods have
been moved to RemoveProj. The AnchorsMain methods has been reworked for clarity, but provide same answer.
The debug statements were cleaned up.
</small></ul>
</ul>

<a id="v534"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.3.4 (19-Feb-23)</h3>
Existing SyMAP databases: if the project parameters seem wrong, bring up the <u>Parameters</u> window
and <ttl>Save</ttl>.
<ul>
<li>All "Help" in the SyMAP <ttb>Project Manager</ttb> has changed to <big>?</big> for online help.
The online has been improved for the parameters explanation;
see <a href="./SystemHelp.html" class="ext" target="_blank">Quick Guide and Parameters</a>.
<p>
<li>The <ttb>Project Parameters</ttb> window is clearer;
see <a href="./SystemHelp.html#projParams" class="ext" target="_blank">Project Parameters</a>.
Since parameters are written to file and database, they can get out of sync; this problem is reduced.
The popup messages are more concise.
<li>The <ttb>Pair Parameters</ttb> window is clearer;
see <a href="./SystemHelp.html#pairParams" class="ext" target="_blank">Pair Parameters</a>.
The parameters used to only be applied if A&S was run right after setting them; now they are
maintained across symap sessions.
<p>
<li>
Developers:
<ul><li><small>There has been a lot of renaming and restructuring. For example, the symap.projectmanager.common package has been shortened to symap.manager,
and a few of the classes in this package were renamed for clarity. All ChrExp and 2d display
classes have been renamed and moved to the frame package. A database package has been
created for the database specific classes. The project and pair parameter code has been redesigned.
</small></ul>
</ul>

<a id="v533"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.3.3 (24-Jan-23)</h3>
This release has various minor changes and additions.
<ul>
<li><ttb>Synteny&Alignment</ttb>
<ul>
<li>Synteny algorithm: The block start and end was assigned coordinates at the mid-point
of the first and last hit; this has been changed to the start of the first hit and end of
the last hit.
<li><ttl>Selected Pair Parameters</ttl>: The <ttl>No Overlapping Blocks</ttl> was removed because it does not work.
The <ttl>Summary</ttl> shows changes from defaults for the <ttl>MinDots</ttl>, <ttl>TopN</ttl> and <ttl>Merge Blocks</ttl> parameters.
</ul>
<li><ttb>Print Image</ttb>
<ul>
<li>Most SyMAP graphics have a print image icon, which was
not working for post Java V8; it now works for any version.
</ul>
<li><ttb>Dotplot</ttb>
<ul>
<li><ttl>Filter</ttl> - see <a href="UserGuide.html#dotplot_filter">DotPlot Filter</a>.
<ul>
<li>
New <ttl>Green</ttl>, <ttl>ID%</ttl>, <ttl>Mix</ttl> and <ttl>Show Block Numbers</ttl> options.
The dot size was moved from the main display to the filter. Add  <ttl><big>?</big></ttl> button.
<li>The filter display now freezes the other panels.
It no longer resets to default Filters on Home or selecting a cell.
</ul>

<li>The cells display all at once; before they were added one at a time.
<li><ttl>Home</ttl> now works for the 2-chromosome dotplot, which goes back to full view.
</ul>

<li>Developer:
<ul>
<li>Compiles under Java 17 with no warnings (removed Observable). Massively reduced and cleaned
Dotplot code. Removed many un-used files from the util package and moved some others to the package of
their sole use. Removed arrow from the end of the gene in the CloseUp. The <tt>classes_ext</tt> have
been cleaned of most unused classes and files.
</ul>
</ul>

<!----------------------------------------------------------->
<a id="v532"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.3.2 (14-Jan-23)</h3>
This release added <ttl><big>?</big></ttl> buttons for online help, and has some small <ttl>Query</ttl> and
<ttl>2D Color Icon</ttl> updates.
<ul>
<li>Load and synteny: <ttl>View</ttl> will show the sequence and annotation paths used along with their date.
If an existing alignment is used, then <ttl>Summary</ttl> will show the date that the alignment was run.
<li><ttl>Chromosome Explorer 2D</ttl>
<ul>
<li>Color Icon
<ul>
<li><ttl>Default</ttl>: Changed from resetting all colors to just resetting the colors for the current tab.
<li><ttl><big>?</big></ttl>: a new button that links to the online user guide for instructions.
<li>Fixed an old bug where the <ttl>Default</ttl> did not always work until <ttl>viewSymap</ttl> was restarted.
</ul>
<li>The <ttl>Sequence</ttl> and <ttl>Hit filter</ttl>, and the <ttl>Selected</ttl> pull-down,
have <ttl><big>?</big></ttl> links to their online help.
</ul>
<li><ttl>Queries</ttl>
<ul>
<li>The selected columns will be saved, as detailed in <a href="Query.html#save">Save Columns</a>.
<li>The <ttl>Help</ttl> has been changed to <ttl><big>?</big></ttl> for online documentation.
<li>A new html page has been created for the <ttl>Queries</ttl> at <a href="Query.html">Query</a>
<li>The columns would sometimes be displayed in a weird order, which has been fixed.
</ul>
<li>Developers: Created <tt>utils/Jhtml.java</tt> that has all html links and code in one place. The <tt>/properties</tt>
only contains colors and mainly those that can be changed by user.
</ul>

<li>Each MUMmer subhit is now shown at the bottom as a full dynamic programming alignment (it was broken up
at each gap).
<li>The MUMmer subhits can overlap, so they are now staggered in the graphic display.
<li>The sequence is no longer converted to uppercase, i.e. if the sequence is soft-masked, it will show on the alignment.
<li>The hit color can be set in the color wheel.
</ul>

<li><ttl>Hit Information</ttl>:
<ol>
<li><ttl>Align Hit</ttl> <font color=green>New</font> :  When hover over a hit-wire and right-click, an information box pops up; that box now has
an <ttl>Align Hit</ttl> button that shows a text alignment in blast-style format.
<li>The Hits for each track are listed in descending start order, and the gap is negative if it overlaps with the previous.
</ol>

<li><ttl>Show Seq Options</ttl> <font color=green>New</font>: The <ttl>Show Sequence</ttl> is now <ttl>Show Seq Options</ttl> which has a popup menu that allows the user
to select whether to show the hit sequence, reverse hit, or region from the selected area.
<li><ttl>Sequence Filter</ttl>: Has a <font color=green>New</font> option <ttl>Show Hit#</ttl> which shows the hit# in the same location as the <ttl>%Id Value</ttl>
(only one of these two option can be active at a time).
<li>Tiny problems fixed:
(1) Fixed a problem where a sequence could not be selected for <ttl>Align</ttl> or <ttl>Show Sequence</ttl> if the zoom region was small.
(2) When the view went from 2D->Circle->2D, the "Selected:" would not be reset to "Zoom All".
(3) The arrow has been removed from the graphical align hit because it meaning was not clear.
(4) The term 'merged hits' was changed to 'clustered hits', where the cluster has sub-hits; the term
merged could be misleading.

</ul>

<li>DotPlot
<ul>
<li>Multiple 2d displays can occur now.
</ul>

<li>Developers: (1) Removed over 15 useless files of code. Removed used Cache from everything.
(2) Cleaned up the Mapper package hit code and Closeup package.
</ol>

<a id="v530"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.3.0 (10-Dec-22)</h3>
For existing SyMAP databases: the database schema will be updated on the first viewing of an existing database.

<p>This release does not have any new features, but FPC was removed from the schema and code, which is an major internal change.
<i>Typically the SyMAP software can view an earlier or later version SyMAP database, but that is
not the case with this release.</i>
<ol>
<li><ttl>Queries</ttl>: fixed a v5.1.9 bug in location filtering.
<li><ttl>Dotplot</ttl>: fixed a v5.1.9 bug; if a region was selected, the Hit Filter was set to show no hits.
<li><ttl>Github</ttl>:
<ul>
<li>Removed most of FPC from the code and Schema.
<br>
<li>Simplify classes_ext and Makefile
</ul>

</ol>
<a id="v521"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.2.1 (1-Dec-22)</h3>
For existing SyMAP databases: The colors in the circle view will be different for the 2nd project.
<ol>
<li><ttl>Circle view</ttl>
<ul>
<li>Whole genome:  <ttl>Reverse</ttl>: A new function that allows the reference to be reversed.
Also, the colors of a project's blocks stays consistent if compared to projects with different number of chromosomes (n&lt;=25).
<li>Chromosome view: The selected reference will have its colors shown by default.
<li>The project name that is reference is in bold italics.
</ul>

<li><ttl>Queries</ttl>:
<ul>
<li><ttl>High</ttl>: Added check box to unselect if the user does not want the selected hit highlighted.
<li>Improved the information for the MUSCLE alignment. See <a href="UserGuide.html#qview">Query Align</a>.
<li>Fixed <ttl>Clear Filters</ttl> to leave <ttl>Chr:</ttl> enabled.
</ul>
<li><ttl>SyMAP manager</ttl>:
<ul>
<li><ttl>View</ttl>: A new  link that brings up the chromosome information for a project.
<li>Collinear computation bug fixes: (1) self-chromosome can cause error so disabled. (2) If
a chromosome had no hits (can happen with small scaffolds), collinear was not computed.
</ul>

<li><ttl>2D Sequence Filter</ttl> bug: "Apply" could perform an unwanted change of boundaries on sequence.

<li>Developers: Removed 3D from code, classes_ext.tar.gz, Makefile.
Put in a check for no projects, as a user's trace showed it can happen.
Remove the Filtered interface. Removed more FPC code (Drawing Panel, Mapper Pool, SyMAP Frame).
Changed 2 Observers to PropertyChangeEvent. Reduce /props from 4 to 1 file.
</ol>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
<a id=v520></a>
<h3>Release: v5.2.0 (20-Nov-22)</h3>
For existing databases, see <a href="SystemGuide.html#update" class="ext" target="_blank">Update</a>; the synteny
algorithm needs to be re-run to get the collinear changes.
<p>This release is concentrated on improving the algorithm and display of <u>collinear sets</u>;
see <a href="./Collinear.html">details</a>.
There is new viewing support for Collinear sets: see <a href="./UserGuide.html#hitfilter">2D Hit Filter</a>
and <a href="./UserGuide.html#qview">Queries</a>.

<ol>
<li>The <tt>symap</tt> and <tt>viewSymap</tt> scripts have been changed to access
<tt>SyMAPmanager</tt> instead of <tt>ProjectManagerFrame</tt>. NOTE: if you are updating, make sure you
get these new scripts!!

<li>Processing
<ul>
<li><u>Collinear sets</u>:
<ul>
<li>The collinear sets algorithm has been greatly improved for more accurate results.
The <tt>Alignment&Synteny</tt> needs to be re-run to compute the updated sets.
<li>Each collinear set has a unique number for the chromosome pair.
</ul>
<li>The <ttl>Hit#</ttl> used in Queries and the 2D display was the index into the database and could get very large.
A <tt>hit number</tt> is now computed during processing, which is a sequential number for the chromosome pair (e.g. there will be
a Hit#1 for each chromosome pair with hits).
</ul>

<li>Chromosome Explorer 2D display:
<ol>
<li><ttl>Hit Filter</ttl>:
<ol type="a">
<li>Has many new options, see <a href="./UserGuide.html#hitfilter">Hit Filters</a>
<li>The <tt>Cancel</tt> and <tt>Defaults</tt> buttons never did work right; they do now.
</ol>

<li><ttl>Color wheel</ttl>, for <ttl>Hits</ttl>, there are two new options:
<ol type="a">
<li><ttl>Hover</ttl> provides the color the hit-wire turns when the mouse hovers over it.
<li><ttl>Highlight1</ttl>  and <ttl>Highlight2</ttl> provides the highlight colors, which alternate
when Collinear sets or Synteny blocks are shown.
</ol>

<li><ttl>Sequence Filter</ttl>:
<ol type="a">
<li><ttl>Gene Delimiter</ttl>: This is a new option, which draws a black line over the top exon of each gene when
they are zoomed enough to see the exons. See <a href="./UserGuide.html#ex2d">2D view</a>.
</ol>
</ol>

<li>Queries
<ol>
<li>The <ttl>Show Synteny</ttl> has been changed to <ttl>View 2D</ttl> with the options (2nd two are new):
<br>(1) Region (kb), (2) Synteny Block, (3) Collinear Set. See <a href="./UserGuide.html#qview">Results</a>.
<li><ttl>Show</ttl>: This is a new option which produces a popup of all data for the selected row.
This allows copying any text.
<li>The collinear column displays the set as N.M, where N is the size and M is the unique set number.
<li><ttl>Gene#</ttl>: This is a new query, where one gene number can be entered (no suffix). This is
a good way to view all hits for a given gene.
<li><ttl>Hit St</ttl>: There is a new column, which is "=" if the two hit ends are equals, else it is "!=".
<li>A hit may align to overlapping genes, but only one hit pair is shown; now the best overlap for each
side is shown (before it was random).
</ol>

<li>Assorted minor stuff
<ul>
<li><tt>ConvertNCBI</tt> script has a new "-p" and "-pa" options to include as attributes the first protein or all protein names for the gene.
<li>Schema update: there is an schema update that occurs the first time an existing database is read.
<li>The <ttl>SyMAP Queries</ttl> button has been moved and renamed <ttl>Queries</ttl>.
The 2D Filter and Color Wheel panels will be displayed in the middle of screen.
The 2D <ttl>Information</ttl> box now shows the <ttl>Hit Filter</ttl> settings.
<li>The SyMAP version of running synteny is on the summary panel.
<li> All visible traces of FPC have been removed. From this release forward, FPC will no longer be supported.
However, there are still releases from AGCoL and Github that support it;
see <a href="SystemGuide.html#update" class="ext" target="_blank">Update</a>.

</ul>
<li>Developers
<br>(1) All 'new Integer()' etc, have been removed.
(2) Schema update: The 'runum' has
been added to the hits table, which provided the set number for collinear pairs. The SyMAP version is now
stored in the projects and pairs table. The annotation table contains a new column for the number of hits.
(3) FPC code is all mixed in with the seq-to-seq; but it is no longer consistent with changes.
</ol>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a id="v519"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.1.9 (26-Oct-22)</h3>
For existing databases, see <a href="SystemGuide.html#update" class="ext" target="_blank">Update</a>.

<p>Release v5.1.7 to v5.1.9 greatly improved the <u>Gene# assignment algorithm</u> and the <u>2D gene placement</u>.
<p>Added -z option: To execute the latest Gene# assignment algorithm, execute <tt>./symap -z</tt>,
then select <ttl>Reload Annotation</ttl>; the synteny algorithm does NOT need
to be re-run.

<h4>(25-Oct-22)</h4>
This release has some interface improvements to SyMAP Query and the 2D gene placement algorithm was improved.
<ul>
<li>SyMAP Project Parameters
<ul>
<li>The <ttl>Parameters</ttl> display has a new parameter
called <tt>abbrev_name</tt> which must be a 4 character abbreviation. This is used in the SyMAP Query
column headings. If one is not entered, then the last 4 characters of the <tt>display_name</tt>
is used.
<li>Bug fix: A <ttl>Save</ttl> after annotation was loaded would zero out the counts for annotation keywords, which
resulted in no annotation keywords (only All_anno) being shown in the <ttl>Query Columns</ttl>; this no longer happens.
</ul>
<li>2D display
<ul>
<li>The gene placement algorithm was improved.
</ul>
<li>SyMAP Query
<ul>
<li>Hit Pairs Table: The <ttl>Location</ttl> columns now include the Gene start/end/len and the strand assigned to the gene in the GFF file.
<li>Single Genes Table: Only shows the columns that are relevant to genes.
<li>Hover over column: the description is shown at the bottom.
</ul>
<li>Load Annotation: This computes the Gene#, and was allowing a gap of 3 without calling them overlap;
this has been changed to 0.
<li>Demos: A few small changes to the annotation files. Params updated.
<li>Developers: Cleaned-up trace and debug flags.
</ul>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Release: v5.1.8 (17-Oct-22)</h3>
For existing databases, see <a href="SystemGuide.html#update" class="ext" target="_blank">Update</a>.

<p>This release continues to concentrates on making the 2D display provide more information.

<ul>
<li>Processing
<ul>
<li>Gene# assignment: the algorithm has been redone so that all overlapping and contained genes
have the same number with suffixes a-z; and if there are more than 26 overlapping genes,
then it starts over with numbers following
the a-z; e.g. Gene #100a, #100z,  #100a1, #100b1, ...
<li>Load sequence: the project will now be removed if the load fails.
</ul>

<li>2D display
<ul>
<li>The placement of overlapping is greatly improved; the improvements depend on reloading the annotation for v518
(though it works as before without reloading).
<li>When the mouse is in the gene space, it will only provide <ttl>Information</ttl> if the mouse is over a gene;
this makes it easier to run the mouse down the gene space to find a given gene number.
<li>The length of the exons is included in the gene tag, e.g. Gene #100a (Exons 3 2123bp)
<li>Right click in the yellow annotation box was not working for 2D from Dotplot or SyMAP Query,
so it has disabled since the right click on gene annotation works fine from everywhere.
</ul>
<li>SyMAP Query
<ul>
<li>The <ttl>Gene#</ttl> column now shows the number and suffix; it is of format chr.genenum.suffix.
For older databases, this does not provide useful information as it expect v5.1.7 format or later.
<li>Single: The logic has been changed so that if you select a project, then you can select a chromosome.
</ul>

</ul>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Release: v5.1.7 (12-Oct-22)</h3>
For existing databases, see <a href="SystemGuide.html#update" class="ext" target="_blank">Update</a>.
<p>This release concentrates on making the 2D display provide more information with different colors for
genes and hits.

<ul>
<li>Processing
<ul>
<li>Gene# assignment: have been numbered with the same gene number; now they are given a suffix, e.g.
Gene #1011a, Gene #1011b. For existing databases, the annotation must be re-loaded to get this feature; then
the synteny needs to be recomputed (existing MUMmer files will be used).
<li><ttc>ConvertEnsembl</ttc> has a new option "-u" to use the sequence names from the FASTA file.
</ul>

<li>Chromosome Explorer:
<ul>
<li>Colors (Color wheel in upper right corner):
<ul>
<li>Hits are now colored brown (hits have the same strand on both sequences) or green (different strands).
<li>Genes can now be colored according to if they are on the positive or negative strand,
where the default is dark blue (positive) and purple (negative).
<li>The FPC options are no longer shown if there is no FPC in the 2D display.
</ul>

<li>Annotation
<ul>
<li>Overlapping genes are now staggered, i.e. the exons of one overlapping gene will be displayed further out than the other.
<li>When right-clicking on a gene or its yellow text box, the results now show the hits to the gene
along with the gene information and exons.
<li>When right-click on a hit-wire (between two chromosomes), a popup of its merged hits is shown (or single hit).
<li>Tiny bug fix: Yellow text box: if one clicked on the outer edge, it would popup the wrong gene.
</ul>
</ul>

<li>SyMAP Query:
<ul>
<li>The Colinear genes was filtering on &gt; instead of &gt;=. It also has new filter of "=";
hence, you can set the chromosomes and the Colinear genes to get all colinear runs of N on a specific
pair of chromosomes (e.g. 3.1.9).
<li>SyMAP does a better job of making filters inactive if they will not be used or have not been "checked".
</ul>
</ul>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a id="v516"></a>
<h3>Release: v5.1.6 (20-Sept-22)</h3>
This release has improvements to the Block display, 2D display and SyMAP Query.
<ul>
<li>Blocks
<ul>
<li>For the single chromosome view: Inverted blocks have dotted outline.
<li>The windows are better sized.
<li>Fixed rare bug: For the initial multi-chromosome view: If there are many chromosomes, they were being cutoff; now the scroll bar allows them all to be shown.
</ul>
<li>2D Display
<ul>
<li>The full gene description can be viewed by right clicking on a gene annotation in the track;
see <a href="UserGuide.html#view" target="_blank" class="ext">UserGuide</a>.
<li>Hover over a hit may include "Inv" (inverted block) and will include "gNrM" (N exon hits, M colinear run size);
see <a href="UserGuide.html#view" target="_blank" class="ext">UserGuide</a>;
</ul>
<li>SyMAP Query
<ul>
<li>Add general columns <ttl>Hit %Id</ttl>, <ttl>Hit %Sim</ttl>, <ttl>Hit #Merge</ttl>
<li>Add species column <ttl>Len</ttl> which is the length of the hit (or merged hit).
<li>Bug Fix: <ttl>Show Synteny</ttl>: the hover over the hit only showed the correct hit <ttl>Information</ttl>
for those below the selected hit - that is fixed.
<li>Gene# of 0 will sort to bottom of table with a '-'.
<li>MUSCLE alignment: (1) Fixed rare bug. (2) The alignment files will be left in the <ttl>muscle</ttl>
directory, but over-written with each new alignment.
</ul>
<li>Alignment&Synteny: (2 tiny things)
<ul>
<li>If promer or nucmer are over-rided in the <ttl>Parameters</ttl>, it will say on the Summary page (unless the
alignment is re-used).
<li>Fixed rare bug: if the <ttl>Parameters</ttl> are changed before <i>any</i> alignment has been done, there is an error
because the <ttl>data/seq_results</ttl> directory has not been created.
</ul>
</ul>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Release: v5.1.5 (13-Sept-22)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Online Docs - the biggest change of this release is an updating of the documentation.
<li>Alignment & Synteny
<ul>
<li>Clear Pair provides option to "only delete synteny from database" or "delete synteny and remove files".
<li>The MUMmer %Sim column is now loaded in addition to the %Id column.

<li>The Hit# will be assigned sorted on the query start coordinate.
</ul>
<li>Chromosome Explorer
<ul>
<li>Hover over Gene: the gene information will be shown when hovering anywhere within the gene's rectangle.
(It used to only show Gene information if the mouse was hovered directly over the center.)
<li>The Hit information now has %Id and %Sim, plus the number of merged hits.
</ul>
<li>Blocks - the chromosome blocks view has a smaller window.
<li>demo_seq2 - Removed duplicate genes (worked okay, but technically wrong).
<li>Developers
<ul>
<li>If all hits are removed (e.g. Clear Pair), the index will be reset so that the next loaded hit will have a HitIdx (Hit #)
that starts at 1.
<li>The alignment files may have header lines. Any line that does not start with a digit will be ignored.
<li>Removed some dead tables from Schema and changed a few datatypes.
</ul>
</ul>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Release: v5.1.4 (4-Sept-22)</h3>

<ul>
<li>SyMAP Query
<ul>
<li>Filters:
<ol>
<li>Added a <u>General</u> section for the annotation and location, since they can work with all other queries.
Made the <u>Single</u> project (Orphan genes and all genes) a separate section.
<li>Add a filter to <u>Show genes w/o hits</u> for a project, which shows all genes.
<li>Changed the <u>Orphan genes</u> filter to show orphans relative to the chosen projects (it was across all synteny
project, even projects selected for the SyMAP query).
<li>The Hit# query did not work in some situations.
</ol>
<li>Improved the query summary. Also, the location had been left off the summary for most filters.
<li>Replaced the result table <u>#Gene</u> column: it was computed per query, whereas the replacement is stored in the database.
The replacement is the order number of the gene along the chromosomes, which stays constant across all queries
and is shown on the Chromosome Explorer Annotation and the hover of the gene.

</ul>
<li>Chromosome Explorer
<ul>
<li>Sequence Filter: If a wrong coordinate was entered, the program exited.
<li>Alignment Bug Fix: only the first part of the alignment was working (fairly recent bug).
</ul>
</ul>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Release: v5.1.3 (30-Aug-22)</h3>
There is no major new development, but small interface improvements and SyMAP Query has a small bug fix.
<ul>
<li>Main window
<ul>
<li>Projects listed on left are now in alphabetical order per category. If the project is loaded
into the database, the load date is shown to its right. If it has computed synteny, the number of syntenies is in brackets.
<li>The symap window is centered, along with the Chromosome Explorer and SyMAP Query window.
<li>viewSyMAP: only shows the projects that have synteny computed.
</ul>
<li>Load Annotation
<ul>
<li>grp_prefix: This can now be removed from existing projects, i.e. if the 'Chr' was left on,
so the 2D display is clustered with Chr01, Chr02, etc, then the 'Chr' can be removed.
<li>annot_kw_mincount: the Help made no sense for this. It has been upgraded to do the following:
the SyMAP Query shows the GFF attribute columns that have &gt;=annot_kw_mincount occurrences.
It can be changed at any time through the symap parameters window.
<li>When the annotation is loaded and the attribute (column 9) is parsed for keywords, the only keywords
considered are those followed by a '=' (it used to allow spaces between keyword and value).
</ul>

<li>2D chromosome view
<ul>
<li>The popup annotation is now a smaller constant sized scrollable window.
<li>The annotation hover and popup coordinates are more readable.
</ul>

<li>SyMAP Query
<ul>
<li>The Block query is now on just the block number along with the selection of chromosomes.
<li>Small changes:
<ul>
<li>The Results Panel includes the number of rows in the query.
<li>The query will not run if there is an error in the input, and there is better error-checking.
<li>The window is smaller and the columns panel in the table is fixed width.
<li>When the full block name is shown, any leading zeros are removed, e.g. 01.03.2&rarr;1.3.2.
</ul>
<li>Bug fix: The Orphan query with one or more chromosome selected gave wrong results (it was obvious); moreover,
if a start or stop was entered, it gave an error. This is fully functional now.
</ul>

<li>Convert
<ul>
<li>Both scripts work if there is not a gff file (they were requiring it).
<li>For both scripts, the bases that are not ACGT are summarized.
<li>ConvertNCBI - anything that does not have "chromosome" in its ">" line is considered a scaffold.
(ConvertEnsembl already does this).
</ul>
</ul>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Release: v5.1.2 (19Aug22)</h3>
This release associates Exons with their genes; hence, your database needs to be
<a href="SystemGuide.html#update" class="ext" target="_blank">updated</a>.

<ul>
<li>Annotation
<ul>
<li>Input format:
<ol type='i'>
<li>The <tt>ConvertNCBI</tt> and <tt>ConvertEnsembl</tt> scripts created separate <tt>gene.gff</tt> and <tt>exon.gff</tt> files; now they
create one file. The <tt>ConvertEnsembl</tt> was not producing a <tt>gap.gff</tt> file, and now it is. Both have been
updated to be aware of more input variations and provide a better summary. See <a href=convert class="ext" target="_blank">Convert</a> for details.
<li>The Demo_seq has separate <tt>gene.gff</tt> and <tt>exon.gff</tt> files; now it has one file.
<li>SyMAP can still load separate gene and exon files, but its association of exon to gene is not as accurate.
</ol>

<li>Schema change
<ol type='i'>
<li>An existing database will be updated the first time it is viewed.
<li><i>This adds a MySQL field to associate Exons with their Gene</i>; for an existing database,
the annotation would need to be reloaded for this to happen and be displayed (see 2d Gene Popup below).
</ol>
<li>Load Annotation
<ol type='i'>
<li>The code was treating 'CDS' as 'exon', now only exons are loaded.
<li>The attributes were not being loaded for Exon; now, the "parent" attribute is loaded for the
exon and shown when it is moused over.
<li>Quotes are removed from attributes.
<li>The exons are now being mapped to the parent gene to be used in the 2D display.
</ol>
</ul>
<li>Chromosome Explorer
<ul>
<li>Tiny bug fix: the "Circ" button get stuck in un-active mode.
<li>2D display
<ul>
<li>Tiny bug fix: For a single contiguous hit for a flipped chromosome, the hit length graphic was
not aligned right.
<li>When the Gene or Exon is moused over, it will include the number of exons or exon#, respectively.
<li>When the hit line is moused over, it will include the project name, start and end coordinates.
<li>2d Gene Popup: Includes the exons for the gene.
</ul>
</ul>
<li>SyMAP Query
<ul>
<li>Add warnings for bad block or collinear input.
</ul>
<li>Developers
<ul>
<li>The code is now Java v8 compliant (no depreciated statements).
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Release: v5.1.1 (31July22)</h3>

These changes are to 'tidy up' things; nothing major.
<ul>

<li>Scripts:
<ul>
<li>The <tt>symap</tt> and <tt>viewSymap</tt> scripts have been changed from Perl to shell.
<li>The <tt>viewSymap3D</tt> script has been removed, but the <a href="./3D.html" class="ext" target="_blank">3D</a> documentation explains
how you could recreate the 3D view.
</ul>
<li>Data directory
<ul>
<li>The <tt>data/fpc</tt> has been tarred and zipped (<tt>fpc.tar.gz</tt>) since it is rarely used anymore.
If the <tt>data/fpc</tt> directory does not exist, then the BLAT args are not shown on
the "Param" window. The FPC-Seq alignments still work.
<li>If the <tt>data</tt> directory does not exist, it is created: (1) on "Add Project",
(2) when redoing an alignment in the database. (The directory will exist if using <tt>symap_5.tar.gz</tt>,
but it will not exist if starting from the code base).
</ul>
<li>Slight display change
<ul>
<li>The Summary shows the following: (1) for a project, if it used mask_genes or
a different min_size then 100000, (2) for an alignment, if the "mummer_path" is set,
or "concat" is unset, or the promer/nucmer parameters are changed. Only creates/updates on
running the synteny.
</ul>
<li>Small changes
<ul>
<li><tt>symap -v</tt> will display important MySQL variables and make suggestions.
<li>It does not try to load hidden files.
<li>It does not allow "cancel" on remove operations.
<li>It displays length of log files (they are appended to, so can become large).
<li>The project parameters <tt>annot_keywords</tt> and <tt>annot_kwy_mincount</tt> are now being saved to the database
so their values are shown correctly in the project parameters window on re-display.
<li>A proper message is given when <tt>viewSymap</tt> tries to read a databases (<tt>symap.config</tt>) that does not exist.
<li>A stacktrace will not be printed to the terminal, only to the error.log (the e.getMessage() sometimes includes a partial
stack).
<li>Developers: removed more dead code.
</ul>
</ul>
Note: this was first released on 27July22, then again on 31July22 with a slight change.


<h3>Release: v5.1.0 (12June22)</h3>
The documentation has
been moved from www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/symap to csoderlund.github.io/SyMAP.
Any references to the online documentation within the code has been updated.
For pre-v5.1 releases, the www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/symap/docs still exists.

<p>The html Help files can now have URL links in them.

<h3>Release: v5.0.8 (1June22)</h3>
<ol>
<li>A new option "Concat" has been added; when this is unchecked, it will not create a
concatenation of the first genome to run against all chromosomes of the second, instead
it perform a chromosome-by-chromosome search.
<li><u>MUMmer4</u> can be used by compiling it on your machine from the /ext directory
and adding its path to the "symap.config" file. See <a href=MUMmer.html>Running MUMmer</a>.
<li>When computing alignment&amp;synteny, all stacktrace errors are now written into error.log.
<li>The database name is prefixed to the "logs/LOAD.log" file name.
<li>A new document has been created for when there is problems running
<a href=MUMmer.html>MUMmer</a> from SyMAP.
<li>ConvertNCBI script was writing the scaffold sequences to end of the last chromosome (this
did not make the annotation or synteny wrong - just extra sequence).
</ol>

<h3>Release: v5.0.7 (4Feb22)</h3>
<ol>
<li><u>MUMmer</u> has been updated since the last SyMAP release; the code in the /ext/mummer4 directory
has been updated for the latest MUMmer. The documentation has been updated accordingly
(see <a href=MUMmer.html>Running MUMmer</a>).
<li><u>ConvertNCBI</u>: (1) Include ncbi_dataset format. (2) Convert hex to character.
<li><u>Parameters</u>: (1) The Load would not work if any numeric parameter was set to blank.
(2) For Alignment&amp;Synteny "Parameters", the Global button was removed as it did not work
except under weird conditions.
<li><u>Help</u>: the viewer Help pages link to the pages at www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/symap. The
approach for Mac was becoming obsolete, so it was changed. For Linux, more supported browsers were added.
<li>Improve documentation.
<li>Developers: Removed all Applet code (was disabled previously, but code was in everything).
</ol>

<!----------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Release: v5.0.6 (2June20)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Some changes were necessary for SyMAP to run with MySQL v8.
	<ul><li>The schema needed a change, which will occur on first reading of database.
	</ul>
<li>SyMAP works on MacOS Catalina 10.15
	<ul><li>It checks each external program to see if it is executable, as this is not automatic with 10.15
	(see <a href="TroubleShoot.html#ext">Trouble Shoot External Programs</a>).
	</ul>
<li>SyMAP can be compiled with Java v14 (some changed were necessary for this).
<li>The Applet has been removed and will no longer be supported. (It is in earlier SyMAP versions, and can
be obtained at <a href="https://github.com/csoderlund/SyMAP">github</a>).
<li>The built-in MySQL database on Linux is no longer supported.
<li>The Alignment&amp;Synteny has a couple checks for 'ordered_against' before processing:
	(1) Is the order_against the same as the other selected project.
	(2) Does the ordered directory already exist.
</ol>

<h3>Release: v5.0.5 (2May20)</h3>

<ol>
<li>Ordering algorithm: The main change is a rewrite of the ordering algorithm, which orders draft contigs
against a completed sequence closely related genome. The previous algorithm sometimes
would put many of the placed contigs incorrectly into 'chrUNK', though the
ordering in the <tt>anchored.csv</tt> file was correct.

<li>SyMAP Manager:
<ul>
<li>Show #genes and #gaps in summary
<li>Add Project: On Linux, the "Add" button would stay disabled, this has been fixed.
</ul>

<li>Chromosome Explorer: Mouse over a hit and the block number will be shown along with the other information.

<li>SyMAP Query:
The "Align Sequence" display now show locations in text box under alignment.
The v5.0.4 introduced a bug where the row selections display were not right, which
is fixed.

<li>Small changes:
<ul>
<li>Running 'symap -v' will check the MySQL variables needed to run at a reasonable speed,
and will output to terminal any variables that need changing.
<li>Block View: When viewing the blocks using VNC, the chromosome that the
	blocks were aligned to was not visible, which has been fixed.
<li>All Pairs button: Is only enabled if there is anything that will be executed when selected.
<li>Load Project: If a file of 100's of draft sequences are loaded, this was flagged as an error (but
still loaded); it no longer called an error, though a message is written to terminal.
</ul>
</ol>

<h3>Release: v5.0.4 (18Apr20)</h3>
<ol>
<li>SyMAP Query has had major changes:
<ol>
<li>It is faster, e.g. finding the hits in synteny blocks for 5 plant genomes did take 9m:32s
and now takes 0m:09s.
<li>The query page has changed to allow more versatile queries.
<li>The PgeneF is only computed if the "Compute PgeneF" option is checked; otherwise, there
is no changes to this function or options.
<li>Some of many minor changes:
<ul>
<li>Selecting a chromosome for a species (or multiples) now only shows hits that involve the
selected chromosomes.
<li>The #RGN column has been removed and a new "Has Gene" column has been added. Note, all species
with a gene overlapping the hit should have 'annotation', but this makes it easier to see in a glance.
Plus, if some genes do not have an ID or some other keyword, it can be confusing looking at the
annotation.
<li>The "Save for Reload" and "Reload Results" have been removed, as it is so much faster, this
does not seem necessary anymore.
<li>Both the Overview and Table Summary have small changes.
</ul>
</ol>
<li>scripts/ConvertNCBI has been updated to also create a gap file.
<li>scripts/symap.sql has been removed and the schema has been incorporated into the Java code.
<li>SyMAP Summary: Displays major parameters for projects that are not loaded.
<li>Chromosome Explorer 2D View: The mouse over provides location information in the "Instruction" box,
plus:
<ul>
<li>The following functions can be applied to the selected region of a sequence track:
"Zoom All Tracks", "Zoom Selected Tracks", "Align (Max 30000)", "Show Sequence", where the
first three are not new, but the labels changed for clarity.
<li>The last one, "Show Sequence", has
been added as there was no way to see the underlying sequence; it is simply a popup of the
selected sequence.
<li>The "Align" view has been slightly changed to add comma's in large numbers and the length of the sequence.
</ul>
<li>The symapApplet.jar was not working in recent releases, which has been fixed.
</ol>

<h3>Release: v5.0.3 (11mar20)</h3>
<ol>
<li><i>Chromosome Explorer 2D view</i>. The "Annotation Description" can be right-click to view
a pop-up of the description; the benefit is that sometimes part of the description is
buried, and the pop-up can be copied.
<li><i>SyMap Queries</i>. (1) The filters set are shown at the top of the table.  (2) The "Only
Orphan Genes" option can now only be used with the "Annotation Description", "Location", and
"Include" options.
<li>If access to MySQL does not work, a message is printed with the Java error message.
</ol>

<h3>Release: v5.0.2 (24feb20)</h3>
<ol>
<li>scripts/ConvertNCBI: (1) Produce a hard-masked genome sequence (input is soft-masked) with
-m flag. (2) Includes the mRNA ID in the product attribute. (3) The product attribute has
been improved.
<li>SyMAP Bug fix for using chromosome and scaffolds in the same project.
<br>The following did not work:
Say the genomic  sequence input was a mix of chromosomes (prefix 'Chr')
and scaffolds (prefix 's'), and the Project parameters were prefix 'Chr' and minsize '10000',
where the minsize filtered out annotated scaffolds, SyMAP would quit if there was
annotation on filtered-out scaffolds; this has been fixed. Also, the documentation
was not correct for mixing sequence types (e.g. prefix 'Chr' and 's'); the Project parameter
'grp_prefix' should be set to blank.

</ol>

<h3>Release: v5.0.1 (16feb20)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Load Annotation
	<ul>
	<li>In the Params interface for a project, the user can set what keywords from the
column 9 "Attributes" field of the gff file to load; this was not working correctly
and has now been fixed.
	<li>The type (column 3) of mRNA was being loaded as a gene, which causes duplicate records;
now mRNA's are ignored.
</ul>
<li>Alignment &amp; Synteny
	<ul>
	<li>Though it was not possible to make MUMmer v4 part of SyMAP, it is possible
to install MUMmer v4 in the /ext/mummer directory and it will work. Instructions
are provided in <a href="SystemGuide.html">System Guide</a>.
	<li>The nucmer "--maxmatch" parameter was automatically used for self-synteny when
a sequence file was being compared with itself; this would result in an extremely
long execution time for large files (e.g. chromosomes). Consequently, this
parameter has been removed, but can now be set by the user in the "Parameter" interface.
	<li><i>Pair Parameters</i>: (1) The user can set parameters in "Self Args", which are only
used when a chromosome sequence is being compared to itself. (2) This interface
was very confusing as to when parameters were saved and what would be used;
this should be clearer now, and is explained in the "Help" for the Parameter interface.
	<li>If only part of the alignments finished and it ended pre-maturely, when run again,
it will not redo any finished alignments.
	</ul>
<li>Internally, goobs of commented out code has been removed.
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Go to top</a>

<h3>Release v5.0 (22jan20)</h3>
New projects cannot be added to v4.2 databases, but they can be queried (e.g. dotplot).
The significant change
is with the file structure for the data, where the old file structure will not
work with this new release as shown further under <a href="#ds">Directory structure</a>.


<ul>
<li>General
	<ul>
	<li>Error messages (and stack traces) are written to error.log
	<li>There was one symap script with various flags, now there is four symap scripts
	with less flags, as follows:
	<table>
	<tr><td><i>Script</i><td><i>Build</i><td><i>View</i><td><i>Has 3D view</i>
	<tr><td><tt>./symap</tt> <td>Yes<td>Yes<td>No
	<tr><td><tt>./symap3D</tt> <td>Yes<td>Yes<td>Yes
	<tr><td><tt>./viewSymap</tt> <td>No<td>Yes<td>No
	<tr><td><tt>./viewSymap</tt> <td>No<td>Yes<td>Yes
	</table>
	<li>The symap -c command line parameter can be used to
	specify a configuration file other than 'symap.config'
	<li>The Summary list of all selected projects has been enhanced.
	</ul>

<li>Query database
	<ul>
	<li>The "Display for Selected Pair:" popup Summary is now available for self-synteny and FPC-Seq
	</ul>

<li>Build database
	<ul>
	<li>Log files: The log files are no longer in the results directories, instead they are in
	the top level <tt>/logs</tt> directory, as follows:
		<ol>
		<li>The output from the loads are concatenated to the file <tt>/logs/LOAD.log</tt>.
		<li>The output during alignment is in the <tt>/logs/&lt;proj1-to-proj2&gt;</tt> directory.
		<li>The output to the terminal from the alignment and synteny computation is
written in the <tt>/logs/&lt;proj1-to-proj2&gt;symap.log</tt> file.
		</ol>
	</ul>
<li>Load project
	<ul>
	<li>The input files can be gzipped (end with .gz)
	<li>The Parameters menu uses the previous location for the file/directory finder.
	<li>Add ConvertEnsembl.java to convert an Ensembl file to SyMAP annotation file.
	</ul>

<li>Alignment &amp; Synteny
<ul>
	<li>The trace output to terminal is much more informative.
	<li>The alignments for self-synteny have been optimized, which also
  changes the results (e.g. demo_seq now has some tiny blocks were before
  it had none).
	<li>The number of CPUs can be set in the interface, or either of the following:
		<ol>
		<li>Use the -p command line parameter, e.g. <tt>./symap -p 12</tt>.
		<li>Set the 'nCPUs' configuration parameter in the symap.config file, e.g. <tt>nCPUs=12</tt>.
		</ol>

	<li>Much of the code for building the syntenies has been re-written, but the results
	are basically the same with a few tiny differences.
</ul>

<a id="ds"></a>
<li>Directory structure: The following are the directory changes, where they
are under <tt>/data</tt>.
	<table>
	<tr><td><i>New</i><td><i>Old</i><td><i>Description</i>
	<tr><td>/seq
		<td>/pseudo
		<td>Directory for sequence projects
	<tr><td>/seq/&lt;project&gt;/sequence
		<td>/pseudo/&lt;project&gt;/sequence/pseudo
		<td>Default directory for sequences
	<tr><td>/fpc_results
		<td>/fpc_pseudo
		<td>Directory of FPC to sequence project results
	<tr><td>/seq_results
		<td>/seq_pseudo
		<td>Directory of two sequence project results
	<tr><td>/seq_results/&lt;proj1-to-proj2&gt;/align
		<td>/pseudo_pseudo/&lt;proj1-to-proj2&gt;/anchor
		<td>Directory of alignments
	</table>
</ul>

<h3>Version 4.2</h3>
Release date:  4/23/2014
<p><b>New Features:</b>
<ul>
<li> New, unified web access applet interface. Now you can present a unified SyMAP web display of some or all
of the projects in your database using just one small HTML page (no CGI). Applet interfaces are also
available for each of the sub-functions (dotplot, circle view, etc.) enabling customized web displays.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Modified Features:</b>
<ul>
<li> The Explorer has been updated to be more usable for draft projects, i.e. when there are many
sequences that have not been ordered and anchored to pseudomolecules. Specifically, it will now show
up to 450 sequences, and to decrease clutter it shows only sequences that actually have a synteny block.
<li> The prior web system files have been removed, including the cgi and supporting perl modules.
<li> The circle view now draws all text labels horizontally, due to rendering problems
with rotated text on several platforms (most severely on Mac). The rotated text is still available through a
checkbox option.
It is no longer necessary to run the perl install script to install web functionality.
</ul>
<h3>Version 4.1</h3>
Release date:  2/20/2014<br>
<p><b>New Features:</b>
<ul>
<li> Publication-quality image saving. A save button has been added to every graphical window allowing saving to
a wide variety of formats, including scalable vector formats (svg, eps, pdf) which may be resized clearly to any size. (Many thanks to the developers of the FreeHEP Vector Graphics library, and especially Mark Donszelmann, for making this possible!)
<li> Download of block co-ordinates. Choose the species of interest, open the Explorer, and the download button is at the lower left.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Modified Features:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Applet is signed with a DigiCert certificate, removing the security blocks which have been increasing
in recent Java versions.
<li> MUMmer binaries for Mac OSX have been replaced by 64-bit versions. The 32-bit versions which had been
supplied could not access more than 2G RAM, preventing alignment of many chromosomes.

</ul>
<p>
<h3>Version 4.0</h3>

<li>Added order_against parameter, to specify reference sequence for ordering scaffolds
	(the order only affects the dotplot display)
</ul>
<li>Minor changes to CGI page displays to better accomodate unordered.
<li>Fix compilation error in 64-bit MUMmer binary, which prevented use of very long pseudomolecules.
</ul>

work with you to it.</font>
</ul>

<h3>Version 3.1</h3>
Release date:  2/12/10<br>

<br>
<b>New Features in User Interface:</b>
<ul>
<li>Multi-genome 3D viewer.</li>
<li>Circular CGI view.</li>
<li>Gene search CGI.</li>
<li>Support for sequence-to-sequence alignment.<li>
<li>Option to flip sequence.</li>

<li>Hits are now clustered based on gene annotation and drawn as "ribbons" to indicate locations of sub-blocks.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 2.0</h3>
Release date:  5/18/07<br>
This release includes many new features for the alignment view.  The dot plot view was
not changed.<br>

<br>
<b>New Features Block view (CGI):</b><br>
<ul>
<li> <i>View reverse</i> option: reverse which of the two genomes is the reference genome.
<li> Chromosome view: the blocks are color coded to indicate which chromosome they are from. Also, the number of anchors is displayed over each block.
</ul>

<b>New Features on Java interface:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> Filters:
<ul>
<li> For a given track (Block, Hit, Sequence) hover the mouse over the track and
right click. A menu of the most common filters is shown;
this is much easier than opening up the Filter window.
<li> From this window, you can go directly to the help for the given track.
There is also a 'Navigation Help', as there are many ways to resize, scroll, etc.
</ul>
<li> Sequence track:
<ul>
<li> <i>Show hit score bar</i> is a new filter that
shows the hits down the length of the sequence as a histogram showing how strong each hit is.

<li> <i>Show Hit Score Value</i> is a new filter that shows the %identity.
Note that the sequence graphic is twice as wide to show the score bar and score value.
<li> The sequence track can be scrolled by moving the mouse wheel when the
mouse is position over the sequence track.
This retains the same zoom and filters, but moves up or down the lenght of the sequence (i.e. pseudomolecule).
<li> The gene annotation now shows the intron/exon structure.
</ul>
<li> Hit track:
<ul>
<li> <i>Show Only Gene Hits (contained)</i> is a new filter that turns off the
display of all hits unless they are contained in an annotated gene.
<li> <i>Show Only Gene Hits (overlap)</i> is a new filter that turns off the
display of all hits unless they overlap an annotated gene (but is not contained in a gene).

<li> <i>Show Only Non-Gene</i> is a new filter that turns off the
display of all hits unless they are NOT overlapping or contained in a gene.
<li> Hit lines are highlighted in red when mouse positioned over a hit.
</ul>
<li> Block track:
<ul>
<li> When hovering over a contig, the contig information at the bottom of the
display includes all the chromosomes that the contig hits.
</ul>
<li>Bug Fixes:
<ul>
<li> Genes drawn incorrectly when sequence range within gene boundary.<br>
<li> Fixed bug with pseudomolecule filter.<br>
<li> Certain queries were failing when used with MySQL 5.0.26 due to comma precedence change.<br>
</ul>
</ul>
<b>New Features in Back-End Processing:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> Support for mixed letter/number chromosome names and arbitrary ordering (see example in demo-fpc params file)
<li> Pseudomolecule sequences loaded in 1Mb chunks, removing database problems with large text fields
<li> Filtering optimized in anchors.pl to reduce memory use in loading large blat outputs
</ul>
