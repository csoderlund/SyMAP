Below is a image depicting an <b>FPC-to-sequence comparison</b> for Maize FPC
(chromosome 3) to Rice (chromosome 1) to Sorghum (chromosome 3).
Note that rice chr1 is the "reference"
chromosome, hence is placed in between the others.

<a href="img/alignSeqFPC.png"><img src="img/alignSeqFPC.png" alt="alignSeqFPC" style="border: 1px solid black; width: 650px"></a>
<p>
The alignment window displays "tracks" (drawn as rectangles) of sequence information, showing synteny  "hits" (drawn as lines) between tracks.
<p>
There are three types of tracks:
<ul>
<li><a href="#sequence_track">Sequence Track</a> - sequenced chromosome or draft sequenced contig.<br>
<li><a href="#contig_track">FPC Contig Track</a> - single contig from FPC map.<br>
<li><a href="#block_track">FPC Block Track</a> - group of contigs from FPC map.<br>
</ul>
Left click in a track shows the most commonly used filters and features (e.g.
flipping the region). They are also on the filter menu above each track
(e.g. Sequence Filter). See the Filter descriptions below.

<b>History (Home, &lt;, &gt;)</b> SyMAP retains a record of the prior views (like a web browser).
The history navigation back (<b><big>&lt;</big></b>) and
forward (<b><big>&gt;</big></b>) buttons allow you to
move back and forth through the previous views.
The <b>Home</b> button returns to the initial view.
<p>

<b>Zoom Buttons (-, +)</b>
The zoom buttons allow for quickly expanding and narrowing the view region.
 The minus (<b><big>-</big></b>) button shrinks the view region by 50%, keeping

again keeping the same center.

<b>Scale Button</b>
The Scale button
(right of <b><big>+</big></b>) resizes the tracks so that they are in the same scale
(base pairs per pixel) as the reference sequence track in the view.

<h3>Tracks in Main Panel</h3>
<td style="text-align: right"><a href="#top">Go to top</a></td></tr></table>

The main panel is divided into "tracks",
where each track represents an FPC map or sequence. Each track
is aligned to the tracks to its immediate left or right, and the
individual pieces of evidence for synteny (referred to as anchors or "hits") are drawn as
lines between the two tracks, color-coded by type. Above each track
is a "filter" button which allows configuration of the content displayed for
that track (e.g., annotations), and above the space between each pair of tracks
is a "hit filter" button that allows selection of the types of hits displayed
between the tracks on either side (e.g., only show syntenic hits).

<a id="sequence_track"></a>
<h4>Sequence Track</h4>

A <b>Sequence</b> track represents a contiguous piece of sequenced DNA,
typically for a sequenced chromosome. The sequence length
and the coordinates of the displayed region are indicated above and below the track.
<p>
Annotation data of the following types may be loaded into SyMAP and displayed.
(Note that display colors <a href="#control">can be changed</a>.)

The sequence information displayed can be configured via the

mouse over the sequence track.
<p>
The example below shows a sequence-to-sequence alignment.

<p>
<a id="seqtrackimg"></a>
<ul><li>
The black lines down the center of the Brachypodium chromosome indicate predicted
genes; this annotation file did not include exons.
The black lines with heavier blue bars interspersed down the center of the rice chromosome indicate exon/intron
predictions; the annotation file included both genes and exons.
</ul>
<table><tr>
<td style="vertical-align: text-top;">
<ul>
The alternating brown/gray lines indicate anchor clusters. The solid brown lines indicate
a single anchor (or multiple anchors very close together), while the gray lines are spaces with no alignment.

A <b>Block</b> track shows a block of FPC contigs, which is simply
a list of contigs arranged end-to-end. This track
type allows alignments to be displayed which stretch across more than one
FPC contig. Individual <a href="#clones">clones</a> are not shown in a

both clones and markers to neighboring tracks are shown.
<p>
Clicking on one of the contig rectangles of a block track
brings up the contig track display for that particular contig. The filter options
that are shared with the Contig track are maintained.
<b>Block Title</b>
A Block track may simply be a group of contigs, in which case the block title is the
project name (e.g. "Maize").  Or a block track may contain a <b>synteny block</b>,
identified by SyMAP software, in which
case the Block Title includes the Synteny Block Number.  The Synteny Block Number
consists of three fields:
<pre>
Project1Chromosome.Project2Chromosome.BlockID
</pre>
In the screenshot above, the Synteny Block Number "6.1.1" refers to Maize Chromosome 6
mapped to Rice Chromosome 1, synteny block #1 of this pairing.

The <b>Contig </b> track shows a detailed view of the <a href="#clones">clones</a>

clones to neighboring tracks are shown as lines going to the clones. If the
hit is from a BES on the clone, the line is drawn to one end of the clone, while
if the hit is from a marker attached to that clone, the hit is drawn to the middle
of the clone. Because a marker may be attached to many clones, a hit from
a particular marker is drawn from a red "marker join dot" to the side of the
contig, and the join dot is then connected to each of the clones to which
the marker is attached.
<p>
Since a contig track is usually accessed by choosing a contig from a block

Marker hits are green, while BES hits are purple.Clicking on a hit brings up the hit's
BLAST view in the bottom of the dialog. The hit presently shown in the BLAST view is
shown in gray.  The full length of the marker/BES is shown as a grey dotted line above
the hits.A vertical red line along a hit represents a mismatch .  A vertical green line
along a hit represents a deletion. An arrow pointing down (i.e. 'v') along a hit
represents an insertion.
<p>

<b>Genes</b><br>
Annotated genes are displayed below the hits.  Exons are represented by a blue box, and
the leftmost or rightmost exon box will have an arrow tip indicating whether the gene
is on the + strand (right-pointing) or - strand (left-pointing) relative to the
sequence. The system attempts to expand the view to show the full gene that has
hits. Genes that overlap this gene will be partially shown.

<li>If contigs are not anchored to chromosome, they will be on chromosome 0. If chromosome 0 is part of any blocks, they are only be shown on the block display.
<li>The block display only shows the FPC chromosomes aligned to the sequence chromosomes; the reverse does not work.
<li>The Colors (see Color Wheel on top right of 2D display) can only be changed on the <ttl>Chromosome Explorer</ttl>,
but any changes there will also be reflected when viewing a 2D display from the <ttl>Dot Plot</ttl> or <ttl>Block View</ttl>.
