v5.5.7 These scripts are part of the xToSymap interface.
See https://csoderlund.github.io/SyMAP/input/index.html

They are here in case they need to be edited:

ConvertNCBI.pl - converts NCBI genomic.fna and genomic.gff to SyMAP input
ConvertEnsembl - converts Ensembl .fa and .gff3 files to SyMAP input
See https://csoderlund.github.io/SyMAP/input/index.html

lenFasta.pl - prints the summary of the lengths of sequences in a fasta file,
	which is useful for draft genome sequences to determine minsize cutoff.
