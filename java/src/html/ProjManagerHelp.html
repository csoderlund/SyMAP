<h2>Summary Section</h2>


<div style="width:500px">
The projects selected from the <b>Projects</b> in
the left panel are listed in this Summary Section. 
The possible functions vary with the state, as listed below:

<table border='1' cellpadding='5' rules=all>
<tr><td><b>Function</b><td><b>Description</b>

<tr><td colspan=2><i>If there is any project not loaded to the database, you will see:</i>
<tr><td valign=top>Load All Projects<td  valign=top>Load all projects that have not been loaded yet. 

<tr><td colspan=2><i>If a project <b>is not</b> loaded to the database, you will see:</i>
<tr><td valign=top>Remove project from disk<td  valign=top>Remove your files from disk. The project will no longer be shown on the left.
<tr><td valign=top>Load project<td  valign=top>Loads the sequence and optional annotations to the database. 
<tr><td valign=top>Parameters<td  valign=top>This brings up a panel of paramters.
Make sure the parameters are set right before loading the project.

<tr><td colspan=2><i>If a project <b>is</b> loaded into the database, you will see:</i>
<tr><td valign=top>Remove project from database<td  valign=top>The sequences and annotation will be removed, but the files stay on disk.
<tr><td valign=top>Reload project<td  valign=top>Executes "Remove project from database" followed by "Load project". 
<br>If there are
alignment files, you will be asked if you want them removed; if your sequences or grp_prefix (see parameters) have
changed, say 'yes' as the alignment needs to be run again.
<tr><td valign=top>Reload annotation<td  valign=top>Removes and then load the annotations. 
<br>The "Alignment & Synteny" commands will 
recognize that the alignments have already be performed and will only perform the synteny computation. If you 
want the alignments to be re-run, you need to "Clear" each respective cell.
<tr><td valign=top>Parameters<td  valign=top>After the project is loaded, you can still change the Summary parameters.

<h2>Available Synteny Section</h2>
<div style="width:500px">
This section shows a table with the status of alignments between
the selected projects. (Only projects loaded to the database are shown.)
<p>
Each cell in the table represents a pair of projects (labeled on the
rows and columns) and the cell contains a status code showing
 whether or not that pair has been aligned (codes are listed below). Note that the table
actually shows each pair twice, but only the lower cells are activated.
<p>
Clicking on a cell selects that pair of projects (the cell then highlights in yellow). 
Alignment and synteny may then be computed or viewed for that particular pair, using
the function buttons (described below). If no cell is selected, you can still
use some of the function buttons, which apply to all the cells.

		The alignment (MUMmer or BLAT) has been performed but the anchors have not been
		loaded and the synteny computation has not been run. This status occurs if
		a pair is completed but then annotations are re-loaded for one of the projects,
		or if the MUMmer files have been added by the user (see website "System Guide" for details).
	</td>

	<td align="left" valign="top">

	</td>
	<td align="left"  valign="top" width="550" >
		SyMAP puts an empty file with the name 'all.done' in the /align directory to indicate
		all alignments successfully completed. If this file is not present, the alignment
		may not have completed. In this case, any alignments will be completed and the 
		synteny run.

<p>
<b> CPUs parameter:</b> Enter the maximum number of CPUs you wish to use for an alignment. SyMAP will use 
up to that number (but may use fewer, depending on the number of sequences being aligned). Alternatively,
the number of CPUs may be entered as a command line argument (-p N) or entered in the symap.config file.

		Run (or complete) the alignment & synteny computation for the selected project pair. 
		If the pair is already complete, the button label changes to "Re-do", and 
		the function is to re-run the synteny computation only. If you wish to re-run
		the BLAT or MUMmer alignment also, first use the "Clear Pair" function.

		Run (or complete) the synteny computation for all pairs in the Available Syntenies table. 
		However, this will not run 'self-syntenies'; those need to be done individually by selecting
		the pair.
