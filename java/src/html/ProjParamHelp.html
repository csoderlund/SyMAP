<h2>Sequence Project Parameters</h2>
<p>
This page provides all the setup parameters for a sequence project.
The most important are the following:
<p>
<b>sequence_files</b>
<p>
Select the fasta-formatted sequence files, or directories
of sequence files, to upload to the project. There must be at least
one sequence file. Note that a file can contain multiple sequences. 
<p>

<b>anno_files</b>
<p>
Select gff3-formatted annotation files corresponding to your sequences. SyMAP currently
recognizes annotations of type <tt>gene</tt>,<tt>exon</tt>,<tt>centromere</tt>,<tt>gap</tt>,
and <tt>CDS</tt> (treated the same as <tt>exon</tt>). The type is read from column 3 of
the gff file. Annotation is optional but highly recommended. 
<p>
<b>grp_prefix</b>
<p>
The parameter effects the display, but is applied during the loading of the sequences.
If provided, this allows SyMAP to remove the prefix from the chromosome or contig 
names and use the remaining part as a shorter name (e.g. "100" instead of "contig_100");
sequences which don't match the prefix will use their full names.
<br><i>Long names really clutter the display</i>; it is best to use a consistent prefix that SyMAP can remove,
otherwise, use really short prefixes, e.g. 's' for scaffold, 'c' for chromosome.
NOTE: If you change this after load, you need to re-load and re-run all computations!
<p>

<!-- <b>grp_sort</b><p> How your sequences should be ordered, either numerically, alphabetically, or in the order
found in the fasta file (this only works if they are all in one file). Note that you
can change the ordering from "file" to one of the others, without reloading the files.

<p>
<b>Other parameters</b>
<p>The following table is broken into section on what needs 
to be re-run following the parameter change.

		Minimum size of sequence to load, in bp; smaller sequences will be ignored. Note that annotations

		mask_all_but_genes
	</td>
	<td align="left"  valign="top" width="400" >
		Mask out all non-genic parts of the sequences before running MUMmer (gene annotation must

		no

		order_against
	</td>
	<td align="left"  valign="top" width="400" >
		For draft contig sets, this allows you to order them using synteny to 
		one of the other projects. 
		The ordering occurs automatically after the synteny alignment is run, and a file showing 
		the ordering is printed into the project folder. A new "Anchored" project is also created,
		in which the draft contigs are concatenated into pseudomolecules based on the synteny.
