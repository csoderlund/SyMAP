<h2>Adding a New Project</h2>
<div style="width:500px">

This dialog creates a new, empty SyMAP project. After creating
the project, use the following steps to complete and load it:
<ol>
<li> Select the project in the Projects panel (left side of Manager window)
<li> Add sequences and annotation, and edit parameters, using the "Parameters"
link in the Summary section (top right of Manager window)
<li> Load the project to the database, using the link labeled
"Project not loaded, click to load"
</ol> 
<p>
New project parameters:
<p>
<b>Name</b>
<br>
This is the <i>database</i> name for the project. 
It should be a short and unique name containing only letters, numbers, and 
underscores. In the additional step 1 above, you will be able to 
add a more descriptive display name. 
<p>
<b>Type</b>
<br>
If you have sequences (e.g., fully sequenced chromosomes or draft sequences), choose
"Pseudo". If you have an FPC map, choose "FPC". Note that "Pseudo" stands for 
"Pseudomolecule", a term which is sometimes used for a sequenced chromosome assembly.
