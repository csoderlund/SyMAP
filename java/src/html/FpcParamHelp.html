<h2>FPC Project Parameters</h2>
<p>
This page provides all the setup parameters for an FPC project, as follows:.
<p>
<b>fpc_file</b>
<p>
Browse to the FPC file you wish to load.
<p>

<b>bes_files</b>
<p>
Select one or more fasta files containing BAC-end sequences for the FPC clones. 
Note that the BES must be named <i>exactly</i> like the FPC clones, plus suffixes
".r" and ".f" showing the strand.  BES which can't be matched to a clone
will be ignored. 
<p>
<b>marker_files</b>
<p>
Select one or more fasta files containing marker sequences. The marker names
must match exactly with the names of markers in the FPC project. 
<p>
<b>grp_prefix</b>
<p>
 If provided,
this allows SyMAP to remove the prefix from your group/chromosome names, and 
use the remaining part as a shorter display name (e.g., "5" instead of "chr5").  
<p>
<b>grp_order</b>
<p>
If you have a mixture of numeric and alphabetic anchoring group names, you can simply list them
here in the desired order. This overrides <tt>grp_sort</tt>.  
<p>
<b>cbsize</b>
<p>
The approximate size of a CB (consensus band) unit, in basepairs. This is used to draw
the FPC contigs to scale against other sequences.
<p>
<b>description</b>
<p>
Description of the project. Currently, this is only shown in the Project Manager Summary 
section.
<p>
<b>category</b>
<p>
Category label for the project, currently only used in the 
Summary list of the Project Manager window.
