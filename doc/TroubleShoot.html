<h3>Not enough memory with standalone</h3>
When running SyMAP as a standalone application:
For very large projects, or queries involving multiple
genomes (e.g., 5 or more), the Project Manager may run out of memory.
To fix this problem, run symap with the -m parameter to increase the maximum
memory used from the default 2048 MB to 4096 MB.:
<pre><b>     &#62 ./symap -m 4096</b></pre>
Alternatively, you can edit the file <tt>symap</tt> and change
<pre>
my $maxmem="2048m"; # change this line to use "4096m" 
</pre>

You will also need to be using a 64-bit processor.

<a name="database_error">
<h3>Database connect errors</h3>
Error messages mentioning the database or SQL probably mean that the database connection
could not be established or was lost. A message at startup means SyMAP was not able
to connect to the database using the provided information in symap.config; see below for 
steps to debug this. 
<p>
After startup, if the program is left idle for some time then its
database connection will close and it will show a complicated-looking error on 
next usage. In this case the solution is to restart the program.
<p>
Following are some things to check for connection problems on SyMAP startup:

<h4>Check the database privileges</h4>
The database users specified in symap.config may not have necessary access to the database.
If you are running the standalone version, then the relevant user is 'db_adminuser' (unless
you are running a read-only session using 'symap -r' parameter). If you are running
through the web applet, then is is 'db_clientuser'. In either case the user needs
to have database access privileges <i>from the machine where you are working</i>. Note that MySQL
privileges are granted specifically to certain users on certain machines. You can test 
the user access by using the MySQL command line client <tt>mysql</tt>, if it is installed
on your machine, or by looking at the privilege table using an administration interface
such as PHPMyAdmin. The <tt>mysqlaccess</tt> tool is also useful, if it is installed
on your machine. 

<h4>Check the MySQL configuration</h4>

The MySQL configuration file (/etc/my.cnf) should <b>not</b> contain any
of the following lines that prevent remote access to the database.
<tt><pre>     bind_address=127.0.0.1
     skip_networking 
</pre></tt>

<h4>Make sure the port is visible</h4>
If the database is on a different computer, test that its port 3306 is visible
from your computer:
 <tt>
<pre>     telnet &lt;server address&gt; 3306
</pre>
</tt>
If it doesn't make a connection then either the server isn't running, or 
it is set to run on a non-standard port, or the
port is blocked by a firewall. Contact a system administrator. (Note, 
to get out of telnet type "<tt>^]</tt>".)

<h3>Build problems</h3>

<h4>MySQL and startup</h4>

<a name="innodb">
<h5>The database does not support Innodb tables</h5>
This can happen in a couple of ways ways. Look in the mysql log for clues.  
<li> MySQL started with the "skip-innodb" flag. Solution is to remove this. 
<li> InnoDB log file problems. This can happen if you change the log file size, without
deleting the log file. Solution: shut down mysql, remove the innodb log file, and restart mysql. 

<a name="mysql_norun">
<h5>"The built-in MySQL server cannot run..."</h5>
SyMAP comes with a MySQL server built in, but it does not run right if there is another
MySQL server already running on the computer. There are two solutions: either stop the 
other server temporarily, or edit the parameters file to point SyMAP at that server (or
another server) so it doesn't use the built-in MySQL. 

<a name="root">
<h5>Please read "Security" section of the manual to find out how to run mysqld as root</h5> 
You are launching SyMAP as the unix root user, which is blocked by MySQL 
as a security hazard. Solution is simply to use a regular non-root user account.  

<a name="msqcase">
<h5>Can't create table  (errno: 121)</h5>
This can occur if you try to create a SyMAP database whose name differs only by
case from an existing database, e.g. "symapTest" when "symaptest" already exists. 


<a name="glib">
<h5>/lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.7' not found </h5>
If this occurs while you are doing an alignment, it
 means that some libraries on your system are not compatible with those
required by the version of MUMmer which is included with SyMAP. To solve this
you will need to obtain the MUMmer source code distribution and compile
it on your own system, which is not hard to do (however, 
<a href="#mum64">note this important detail</a>). Then, copy the binary named
"mummer" to the appropriate ext/mummer/&lt;platform&gt; directory and re-run SyMAP. 

<p><a href="#top">Return to top</a><br>

<a name="msqslow">
<h3>Slow to load sequence and annotation</h3>

Two MySQL settings are especially important for SyMAP performance (and generally for InnoDB table
performance). You can set these in the MySQL configuration file "my.cnf" and restart MySQL. 
Note that my.cnf is located at /etc/my.cnf, on both Linux and Mac.
<p>
<table width=600 cellspacing=3 cellpadding=2 border=1 rules=all>
	<tr>
		<td align=left valign=top><tt>innodb_buffer_pool_size</td>
		<td>
The default is too low for most purposes. You should set this to around 1Gb if possible (note that 
the units are bytes). 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align=left valign=top><tt>innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=0</td>
		<td>
The default setting is 1, which results in very slow uploading of data.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
To check the values, start mysql and type:
<pre>
show variables like "innodb_buffer_pool_size"; 
show variables like "innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit"; 
</pre>
To change the variables, then type:
<pre>
set global innodb_buffer_pool_size=1073741824;
set global innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1;
</pre>
Different machines and MySQL installations can produce different results with these variables.
If the SyMAP demo-seq to demo-seq2 load and synteny computations seem slow, 
try different combinations of these two variables to see what performs the fastest inserts.

<a name="status">
<h3>"Status window disappeared"</h3>
Occasionally the status window disappears when running an alignment. 
Clicking the top of the project manager sometimes
brings it back. Otherwise, just check the output to the terminal,
which tells you when it is done. You may
have to restart the project manager to see the results.

<a name="mumFail">
<h3>MUMmer failed</h3>
Try using a hard-masked genome sequence. Ensembl supplies both soft-masked and
hard-masked genome sequences. NCBI supplies soft-masked sequences, where the
ConvertNCBI script can convert the file to hard-mask.


<a name="mum64">
<h3>MUMmer/PROmer cannot handle large sequences</h3>
If the alignment doesn't produce results and you see errors indicating
that PROmer cannot produce the .aaqry file, then the mummer binary may
not be 64-bit. You can tell for sure by looking at the output lines like
<pre>
# (maximum reference length is 536870908)
# (maximum query length is 4294967295)
</pre>
If you see small numbers like this, it is not 64-bit. For 64-bit, the numbers
are extremely large, much larger than any possible genome.
To build a 64-bit mummer, you must set  
<pre>
#define SIXTYFOURBITS 
</pre>
in 
src/kurtz/libbasedir/types.h (and, of course,
compile on a 64-bit machine). We fixed this problem in the 3.4 version of SyMAP, 
for lintel64, but if you're building for a different platform you'll have
to make this fix. 


<a name="noanch">
<h3>"No anchors loaded"</h3>
This message indicates that SyMAP could not parse the MUMmer or BLAT output files
to load the anchors. 
<p>
The most likely reason is that MUMmer or BLAT failed to run.
Usually this is because the platform (linux 32/64 bit, or mac)
was not detected properly. First try re-starting symap using
the '-32, -64, -linux, -mac' parameters to specify your platform 
(run 'symap -h' for list of parameters). 
<p>
The next likely cause is trying to run a whole-chromosome MUMmer alignment on a 32-bit
machine. MUMmer usually uses more than 2Gb per thread, which is not
possible on a 32-bit machine. If you suspect this is the problem, try running
on a 64-bit machine. If you compiled MUMmer yourself, check 
<a href="#mum64">the above section</a>.
<p>
If that does not resolve the problem, The next step is to look in the project
.log file in the /logs directory for 
more detailed error messages. Then, you should look at the MUMmer log
files (extension .mum.log) in the directory
<tt>
<pre>
logs/&lt;proj1_to_proj2&gt;
</pre>
</tt>
These contain the messages printed by MUMmer, and should show why it failed to run.  
<p>

<a name="bes">
<h3>BES not loaded, or BES hits not loading</h3>
Generally, this is caused by a name formatting error. Make sure the BES
names are formatted as clone names with extension "r" or "f". The clone
names should <i>exactly match</i> those in FPC, and there should be no other prefix or suffix. 
Do not use ".r" or ".f".

<h3>Web problems</h3>
<a name="web">
<h4>Unable to view Java applets</h4>

<ul>
<li>SyMAP requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 7 or later. The latest version tested is Java 8 Update 221.
<li>Java Applets ONLY work with Windows Internet Explorer and Mac Safari.
<li>A popup will first appear asking you to confirm that you trust this website.
<li>It is useful to have the Java Console enabled so you can view the SyMAP trace output. 
 </ul>
